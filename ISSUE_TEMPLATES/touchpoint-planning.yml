        ## About Touchpoint Planning
        
        Use this template to plan and track any of the 8 co-design touchpoints. Each touchpoint represents a structured interaction with stakeholders to gather input, provide updates, or make decisions together.
        
        **üìã Before you start:** Review the Touchpoint Reference Guide in `/docs/TOUCHPOINT-REFERENCE.md` for detailed guidance on each touchpoint.
