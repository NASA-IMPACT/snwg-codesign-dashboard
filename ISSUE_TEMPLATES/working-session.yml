        ## About Working Sessions
        
        Working Sessions are internal meetings with your implementation team, SEP Co-Design Lead, and key project stakeholders to plan and refine your co-design approach. These are different from Touchpoints (which focus on stakeholder engagement).
        
        **ðŸ“‹ Before you start:** Review Working Session agendas in `/docs/WORKING-SESSION-AGENDAS.md` for detailed guidance.
