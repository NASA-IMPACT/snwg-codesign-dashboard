      description: Categorize actions based on feedback received
      placeholder: |
        **High Priority Actions:**
        - [ ] Implement simplified navigation option - Rationale: 75% of users requested - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]
        - [ ] Add CSV export format - Rationale: Critical for 3 major agencies - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]

        **Medium Priority Actions:**
        - [ ] Develop advanced user training materials - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]
        - [ ] Research offline capability options - Owner: [Name] - Due: [Date]

        **Future Consideration:**
        - Mobile app development (mentioned by 2 users, not current priority)
        - Advanced analytics features (interesting but beyond current scope)

        **No Action Required:**
        - Request for historical data back to 1980 (noted but outside project scope)
        - Rationale: Would require significant additional resources and scope change
